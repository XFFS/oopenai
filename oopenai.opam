synopsis: "An OCaml Client Library for the OpenAI API"
description:
  "This is an unofficial client library for the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) implemented in OCaml. The library was generated initially by the OCamlClientCodegen code generator for [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech). However, due to various errors in the code generation, a significant portion of this library was manually implemented."
